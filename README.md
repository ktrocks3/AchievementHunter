# Achievement Hunter

I've been trying to learn new technologies, so when a friend asked me about creating a desktop application, I thought it would be a great way to learn how electrons work.

The point of the application is to read through an Excel file, and continuously update it whenever a new game log has been created to be able to "mark off" outcomes that have been explored, so that he can track how many of the 2000+ outcomes he has reached so that he can get to the achievement for beating all achievements

## Installation

Although incomplete, if you want to run it in dev, make sure you're CD'd into the NextJS folder before running
```bash
yarn install; yarn start
```
Once it is packaged though, I should be able to share it as a setup exe file (it should work on Windows and Mac from what I understand but I do not have a MacBook to test this with)

## Usage

```python
yarn start
```
